# Geometric Guardian Interactive Comic Trailer

Welcome to the Geometric Guardian Interactive Comic! This is a browser-based interactive comic that allows you to explore different scenes and play a mini-game. To give you a sense of the comic! 

## How to Use

1. **Navigation**: Open the index.html file in your browser to start the comic. You'll see some arrows appear on the screen after a few seconds. Use the arrow keys on your keyboard to navigate around the scene. (Still being worked on)

2. **Portal**: Click on the "Go to Portal" button to be transported to a different scene (Will be like this till I get browser movement correct). The portal is interactive and will react when you hover over it. You can enter it and will then be taken to the next page.

3. **Mini-Game**: You will automatically be taken here after the portal, Use the left and right arrow keys to move your character (For now he is a Blue Square), and press the spacebar to shoot. 

## Work in progress

1. Moving around to find the portal needs to be correctly done. Button to go to portal for now is used.

2. Tearing screen needs work, Need more objects from the comic to fly by during zoomed in portal time.

3. Mini-game core mechanics finsihed, Needs styling, Also needs Instructions for gameplay somewhere on the screen.
